_A contribution to the modern greek society and its obscure cyber culture - built with [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)_

## Intoduction
This project constitutes an NLP pipeline for detecting emotions in chat messages written in _[greeklish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeklish)_.

## Motivation & Challenges
The challenge is both technically and practically fascinating! An AI that decodes unique mixtures of greek, english, greeklish, emoticons, emojis, mentions and other informal conventions... An AI that understands your and your friends' feelings...!

### Why is it difficult?
- A multitude of custom NLP components are needed, including hand-crafted rule-based matchers and homemade ML models.

### Why is it interesting?
- Humans are in a symbiotic relationship with bots all over the internet. They can even give birth to them on the fly on platforms like discord! In such a world, aren't bots obligated to understand the various humans dialects? After all, humans use these dilects to communicate with each other right in their home!
